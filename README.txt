TO RUN:
First, install Jupyter if you haven't already.  Then, open a command window, navigate to this directory, and run this command:
> jupyter notebook
This should open up a new window in your web browser.  In it, click on "Internet Usage Notebook.ipynb" and you're on your way.

ABOUT THE ORIGINAL DATASET:
The Global Internet Usage dataset was collated by GapMinder, and is hosted on Kaggle.  It has a usability rating of 10.00, which means it is fully documented; it is also very clean and usable, save for some missing values.  It can be accessed through the following URL, which I advise checking out if you have further questions about the dataset:

QUESTIONS THIS ANALYSIS ADDRESSES:
* How does the developer's home country, the United States, rank among the other countries in terms of Internet usage?
* The infographic depicts a mean Internet usage of 66.2%.  Can the dataset confirm or refute this number?
* Urban citizenship and GDP/capita are given in the dataset alongside Internet usage.  Do the former statistics correlate with the latter in any way?
* Is it possible, using a machine learning model, to predict Internet usage from urban citizenship and GDP/capita?
